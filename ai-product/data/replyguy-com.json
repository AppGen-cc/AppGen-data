      "question": "Do you mention the product name or the full URL?",
      "answer": "We highly recommend only mentioning the brand name of your product since mentioning links in posts makes the post more likely to be reported as spam and hidden. We find that humans don't usually type out full URLs in natural conversation and plus, most internet users are happy to do a quick Google Search."

      "question": "How long does it take to start seeing results?",
