      "question": "What is fine-tuning?",
      "answer": "Fine-tuning is the process of training a neural-network AI model with a new concept to generate a 4GB new model file containing the knowledge of the new concept."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are prompts used for?",
      "answer": "Prompts are texts used with the fine-tuned model to generate a set of images."
