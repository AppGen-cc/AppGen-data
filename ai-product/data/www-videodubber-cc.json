      "question": "Can Google Translate do a video?",
      "answer": "Yes, Google Translate can translate videos. However, it doesn't do so directly. You need to upload the video to a platform like YouTube, use the subtitles feature to transcribe the video's audio, and then use Google Translate to translate the subtitles. Finally, you can use VideoDubber.ai to transform the translated text into voiceover and add it to your video."
