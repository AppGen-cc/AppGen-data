  "introduction": "DADABOTS is a project that combines music, science, and engineering to create music using artificial intelligence. The team behind DADABOTS is focused on generating music through neural networks and deep learning algorithms. They have worked on projects involving neural synthesis and have collaborated with artists to explore new musical styles.",

      "question": "How does creating music with SampleRNN work?",
      "answer": "SampleRNN is a hierarchical LSTM network trained on raw acoustic waveforms to generate music by predicting the next fraction of a millisecond. The network is trained to come up with its own music after listening to music samples."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you plan on using this software for retail purposes?",
      "answer": "Neural synthesis is expected to be part of future audio software, but the focus is on collaboration and artistic exploration rather than commercial retail purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you think Music generated by neural networks will have the potential to reach mainstream success?",
      "answer": "The project focuses on exploring genres like math rock and black metal rather than mainstream music, aiming to keep music innovative and fresh."
