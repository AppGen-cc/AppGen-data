  "introduction": "Khroma is a personalized algorithm that allows users to train a neural network powered algorithm to generate colors they like and block ones they donâ€™t, directly in the browser. It creates infinite color combos by learning from popular human-made palettes on the internet and offers viewing options as typography, gradient, palette, or custom image. Users can search and filter the generator by various parameters like hue, tint, value, color, hex, and rgb values. Additionally, they can save their favorite combos to a collection for later reference, including color names, hexcodes, rgb values, CSS code, and WCAG accessibility rating of each pair.",
