      "question": "What is a White-Label plan?",
      "answer": "Once you sign up for a white label, Agency Plan, you can build websites for your clients, but each website will have your logo and colors. Your sites are hosted in a separate cloud instance from other sites."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the White-Label limitations?",
      "answer": "Kopage's Agency Plan comes with an included 5 website limit, but you can create as many websites as you'll ever need: each website over the included limit is only $5/month."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I host White-Label websites myself?",
      "answer": "Yes, sometimes your clients already have a hosting account and prefer to keep their website there: with Kopage's Agency Plan, you can not only keep websites in our cloud, but also self-host websites on the client's own server."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use my own domains?",
      "answer": "Yes, with the white label plan, each new website will have a technical address in your domain, such as client.your-domain.com, but you can link any domain or even register new domains with us."
