    {
      "question": "Do I need to attach my own OpenAI API Key?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is required. By using your own OpenAI API key, you can ensure you're getting the best price on usage and not paying silly markup fees. It also allows us to offer you unlimited AI usage and unlimited formula creation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a setup guide after purchase?",
      "answer": "Yes. There's a quick set-up guide for advanced users and a detailed, step-by-step guide for beginners who are newer to AI and automation. Setup takes ~3 minutes and includes a template document for you to get started with the add-on."

Just replace the prompt & type this into any cell: ...and once you click enter, you'll get your response back from the formula. You can also reference other cells in the prompt and use AI on your own existing spreadsheet data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
      "answer": "After you've got access to the SheetMagic, you can immediately start using AI in sheets and cannot be refunded. But rest assured, users of SheetMagic typically save a few hours in their first use of SheetMagic and can be canceled at any time directly in your account portal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this Sheets add-on unlimited?",
      "answer": "For AI, you can use this an unlimited amount by attaching your own OpenAI key. This means you will pay for API usage to OpenAI, but it is extremely affordable and you can set spending limits through their platform. For scraping, you can scrape unlimited amount and it does not cost anything additional."
    },
    {
      "question": "If I pay for ChatGPT plus, will I still need an OpenAI API key?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the scraping use any OpenAI tokens?",
      "answer": "No, it does not use the Open AI API at all and will not cost you anything additional."
    },

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between you and [x] AI tool?",
