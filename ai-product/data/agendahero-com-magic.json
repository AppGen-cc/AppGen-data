      "question": "How do I ask for event duration?",
      "answer": "Ask in whatever way feels natural to you. You can ask for specific start and end times, such as 11 am to 1 pm. Or you can include a start time with a duration, such as 2pm for 90 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How about time zones?",
      "answer": "If the event you’re creating is in a different time zone than the one you’re in, simply include the event time zone in your prompt. We’ll convert it for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about recurring events?",
      "answer": "Daily, weekly, every-other-week, monthly, and annual recurrence events are supported. Some calendar platforms only copy the first date of the recurrence, but you can modify it on your calendar platform before saving the event."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I invite people to events?",
      "answer": "When you add the event to your calendar, you have the full functionality of your calendar, including the ability to invite people."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I share the results?",
      "answer": "If you know someone who would like to add the same events to their calendars, you can generate a link to the results and share that link with them. You’ll find this option at the bottom of your results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I create more than one event?",
      "answer": "You can create multiple events from a single prompt request (text or image) or by selecting multiple events at once, such as in a newsletter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I create events from images?",
      "answer": "You can create events from images, including screenshots. Open the side panel by clicking on the extension, select the image. Upload or drag a photo into the image area, click Create."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I include hyperlinks?",
      "answer": "If you select or add text with URLs, the URLs will be included in the description. This lets you have everything you need for your event in one place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can results be modified?",
      "answer": "You can modify any results field, including the title, date, time, location, description, and emoji. We encourage you to review the results, as AI can make mistakes."
